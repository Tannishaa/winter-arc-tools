# Cloud Vault: Secure Backup Daemon & Disaster Recovery Tool

A Python-based **System Administration Utility** that automates real-time, secure file backups to AWS S3. Engineered to bridge local development environments with enterprise-grade cloud storage, ensuring **Data Integrity** and **Disaster Recovery (DR)** readiness.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Real-Time Daemon:** Implements a `watchdog` observer to monitor file system events (Create/Modify) and trigger instant sync, minimizing the Recovery Point Objective (RPO).
* **Disaster Recovery (DR):** Automated `restore.py` CLI to reconstruct the local file system from S3 archives, ensuring business continuity during system failure.
* **Multi-Threaded Performance:** Uses `threading` to handle concurrent file uploads without blocking the main process loop.
* **Security First:** Leverages AWS IAM programmatic access and `.gitignore` policies to ensure zero credential leakage.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Core:** Python 3.x, Boto3 (AWS SDK)
* **Automation:** Watchdog (File System Events), Threading
* **Cloud:** AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service), IAM
* **Infrastructure:** Git, AWS CLI
